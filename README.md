## Update

## About 

This plugin provides a convenient way to instantly score a goal in freeplay with just the press of a button.  
Have you ever executed a perfect shot or a new mechanic in freeplay, only to barely miss the goal and lose the opportunity to replay your shot? With this plugin, you can now instantly score the ball in such situations and rewatch your shot.  
Additionally, since some shots look better from different camera perspectives, the plugin allows you to toggle between 3rd person/director camera and POV camera during the replay by pressing a preselected button. This enhances your ability to analyze and improve your gameplay.


## Installation

* Copy `plugins/InstantGoalPlugin.dll` into your plugin-folder (/bakkesmod/plugins)  
* In the game console run "plugin load instantgoalplugin"
 
(Or install with bakkesmod on this website: https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/354)
